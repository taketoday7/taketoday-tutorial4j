***在 JsonPath 中使用表达式***是一个非常好的特性，可以让*JsonPath 简洁而复杂。JsonPath*
中的表达式基本上是评估为布尔值的代码片段。根据结果，仅选择符合标准的节点。让我们进一步了解它，但在此之前，请确保您已完成以下有关
*Json*和*JsonPath基础知识的教程*

- [***json***](https://toolsqa.com/rest-assured/what-is-json/)
- [***jsonpath***](https://toolsqa.com/rest-assured/jsonpath-and-query-json-using-jsonpath/)

在本教程中，我们将使用一个示例 Json，它在 Array 中有一些项目。[***请在我们的JsonPath Evaluator***](https://jsonpath.com/)
中复制以下 Json

## JsonPath 中的表达式

***JsonPath 中的表达式是JsonPath***最强大的功能之一。请注意，表达式在***Xpath***和***CSS 选择器***中也可用。表达式可帮助您创建评估为真或假的条件。
***在JsonPath***中创建表达式之前，您必须了解两个重要符号。

- *? : 问号，表示表达式的开始。使用的语法**[? （表达）]***
- *@ ：在符号处，表示当前正在处理的节点。使用的语法**$.books[?(@.price > 100)]***

现在让我们从上面的 Json 中执行一个简单的任务。

- ***找出所有页数大于 460 的书***

要创建一个 JsonPath 可以获取所有页面大于 460 的书籍，我们必须将问题分为两部分

1. ***创建一个 JsonPath 来检索所有书籍***
2. ***附加表达式以过滤所有页面大于 460 的书籍***

要获取所有书籍，我们可以创建一个简单的***JsonPath：$*** .books 。现在我们必须在数组books 中添加一个表达式。为此，我们将简单地以
***?*** 符号开始一个表达式，然后在当前节点***@***上添加一个过滤器 。一个简单的表达式看起来像这样***?(@.pages > 460)***。

如果我们将 JsonPath 与表达式结合起来，我们将得到： ***$.books[?(@.pages > 460)]***

在[***JsonPath Evaluator***](https://jsonpath.com/)中，只需输入此表达式并查看结果。如下图所示

![JsonPath_0.png 中的表达式](https://toolsqa.com/gallery/Rest%20Assured/1.Expressions%20in%20JsonPath_0.png)

结果将是所有页码大于 460 的书。这是结果 Json

### ***JsonPath 中的逻辑运算符***

就像任何编程语言一样，***JsonPath***支持所有逻辑运算符。下面是我们可以用来创建表达式的逻辑运算符列表。下面详细讨论每个逻辑运算符。

| ***操作员*** | ***描述***                       |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| *==*      | *left 等于 right（注意 1 不等于 '1'）。* |
| *!=*      | *左不等于右。*                       |
| *<*       | *左小于右。*                        |
| *<=*      | *左小于或等于右。*                     |
| *>*       | *左大于右。*                        |
| *>=*      | *left 大于或等于 right。*            |

尝试以上所有示例，并尝试根据您的需要创建更多表达式。通过这种方式，您将了解有关***JsonPath***表达式的更多信息。

### ***等于 JsonPath 中的 (==) 运算符***

顾名思义，操作员检查左侧是否等于右侧。让我们找出所有有 352 页的书。这是 JsonPath

***JsonPath: $.books[?(@.pages == 352)]***

***结果将是：***

### ***不等于 JsonPath 中的 (!=) 运算符***

当我们想根据条件***排除***一组特定的值时，我们使用不等于运算符。让我们把上面的例子倒过来，找出所有***页码不等于 352***的书。

***JsonPath: $.books[?(@.pages != 352)]***
